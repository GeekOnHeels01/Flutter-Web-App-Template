# Flutter Web App Template

A template of a web app in Flutter

## 

This a very basic template, just a skeleton of a web app that can easily be scaled as needed. There are two main folders under lib; 'views' and 'widgets': 

- The *views* folder contains the 'home' folder which contains the 'home_view.dar' file inside it. 'home_view.dar' contains the **widget** (class) **HomeView** which is basically divided in three sections. NavigationBar, ContainDetails and CallToAction -.
 **NavigationBar** is the navegation bar on top, **ContainDetails** is the left side of the app with the content and details of the app and the **CallToAction** is the right side view which has only a simple button widget.  

- The *widgets* folders is where all the classes are which in Flutter are called **widgets**. It is in this folder where the work is mostly done.
